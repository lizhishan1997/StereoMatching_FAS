# StereoMatching_FAS

This code is from article "An Effective Face Anti-Spoofing Method via Stereo Matching" ([Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9403897) has been accepted by IEEE Signal Processing Letters).

Since product is to be used for commercial purposes, we open the test source code here and provide several test data. The structure of our method can be fully understood from the test code. 

The deep learning framework we use is Pytorch 1.4.

To test, just run:
```
python Test_images.py
```
